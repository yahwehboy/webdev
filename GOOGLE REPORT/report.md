Absolutely! Submitting a well-structured and professional vulnerability report to **Google's Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP)** via [https://bughunters.google.com/report](https://bughunters.google.com/report) is crucial for ensuring your report is reviewed efficiently and taken seriously.

Below is a **comprehensive, Google-compliant vulnerability report template** tailored to meet the standards expected by Google’s security team. This template follows best practices and includes all the sections Google typically expects.

### 🔒 **Vulnerability Report Template for Google Bug Hunters**

---

#### **1. Summary**

Provide a concise, one-sentence description of the vulnerability.

> _Example:_  
> A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the user profile page of [Product Name] due to improper input sanitization in the 'displayName' parameter.

---

#### **2. Affected Product / Service**

Clearly state the Google product or service you are reporting.

> _Example:_  
> Google Keep (Web Application)  
> URL: https://keep.google.com

> _(Tip: Be specific — include the product name, platform (web, Android, iOS), and version if applicable.)_

---

#### **3. Vulnerability Type**

Specify the category of the vulnerability using standard terminology.

> _Examples:_
>
> - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
> - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
> - Open Redirect
> - Information Disclosure
> - Authentication Bypass
> - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
> - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
> - OAuth Misconfiguration
> - etc.

---

#### **4. Steps to Reproduce**

Provide **clear, step-by-step instructions** so the reviewer can reproduce the issue. Include HTTP requests if applicable (e.g., using cURL or browser dev tools).

> _Example:_
>
> 1. Log in to https://keep.google.com with a valid Google account.
> 2. Navigate to Settings → Profile.
> 3. In the "Display Name" field, enter the following payload:  
>    `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`
> 4. Click "Save".
> 5. Refresh the page.
> 6. Observe that the script executes in the context of the domain.

> _(Optional: Include cURL commands if relevant)_
>
> ```bash
> curl -X POST https://keep.google.com/api/profile \
>   -H "Authorization: Bearer <valid_token>" \
>   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
>   -d '{"displayName": "<script>alert(1)</script>"}'
> ```

#### **5. Proof of Concept (PoC)**

Include **evidence** that the vulnerability is exploitable.

- Screenshots (with annotations)
- Video (if allowed via upload or link)
- Console output
- Network logs (redact sensitive data)

> _Note:_  
> Do **not** include automated scanning tools’ output (e.g., Burp Suite Pro scanner alerts). Focus on manual verification.

---

#### **6. Impact**

Explain the **security impact** of the vulnerability. Who is affected? What could an attacker do?

> _Example:_  
> An attacker could craft a malicious link that, when visited by a logged-in user, steals their session cookies or performs actions on their behalf. This leads to account compromise and unauthorized access to private notes.

---

#### **7. Suggested Fix / Remediation**

Provide a **constructive recommendation** for fixing the issue.

> _Example:_  
> Sanitize user input in the 'displayName' field by encoding special characters (e.g., `<` → `&lt;`) before rendering in the UI. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate script execution.

---

#### **8. Additional Information**

Include any other relevant details:

- Is the issue exploitable without authentication?
- Does it affect all users or only specific roles?
- Have you tested in multiple browsers?
- Is this a logic flaw or configuration issue?
- Any related bugs you’re aware of?

> _Example:_  
> The vulnerability is exploitable only by authenticated users, but since profile editing is allowed, any user can self-exploit and potentially chain this with social engineering.

---

#### **9. References**

Link to relevant standards or documentation.

> _Examples:_
>
> - OWASP XSS: https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/
> - Google Security Developer Guide: https://security.googleblog.com

---

#### **10. Disclosure Consent**

Google requires you to confirm you won’t publicly disclose the issue until it’s resolved.

> ✅ I agree not to disclose this issue publicly until Google has had a reasonable amount of time to address it.

---

### 📌 Final Tips Before Submission:

- **Do not** perform brute-force, DoS, spam, or phishing attacks.
- **Avoid** accessing or modifying other users’ data.
- **Use your own test account only.**
- **Remove** any sensitive data (tokens, cookies, personal info) from screenshots/logs.
- **Be patient** — triage may take several days or weeks.
